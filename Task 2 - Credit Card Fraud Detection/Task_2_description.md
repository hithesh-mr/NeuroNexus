# Task 2 : Credit Card Fraud Detection 
## Description
For my second task, I focused on constructing machine learning models for binary classification aimed at identifying fraudulent transactions in credit card data. The model was trained on the [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kartik2112/fraud-detection).
To achieve this, I systematically implemented and evaluated several machine learning algorithms.

The algorithms employed in this endeavor included 
* Decision Tree 
* RandomForest
* Fully Connected Deep Neural Network

By employing a varied range of machine learning techniques, the objective was to determine the algorithm or combination that produced the most accurate and dependable predictions for the provided dataset. This thorough exploration sought to improve the overall classification model and provide valuable insights.

The Decision Tree and Random Forest algorithms demonstrated high accuracy on both training and testing datasets. Consequently, I aimed to enhance model generalization by employing a Fully Connected Deep Neural Network. This approach yielded a notable and more generalized fit for the data, effectively detecting both fraudulent and non-fraudulent transactions.
