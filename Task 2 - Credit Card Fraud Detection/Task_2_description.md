# Task 2 : Credit Card Fraud Detection 
## Description
For my second task, I focused on constructing machine learning models for binary classification aimed at identifying fraudulent transactions in credit card data. The model was trained on the [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kartik2112/fraud-detection).
To achieve this, I systematically implemented and evaluated several machine learning algorithms.

The algorithms employed in this endeavor included 
* Decision Tree 
* RandomForest
* Fully Connected Deep Neural Network

By utilizing a diverse set of machine learning approaches, the goal was to ascertain which algorithm or combination there of yielded the most accurate and reliable predictions for the given dataset. This comprehensive exploration aimed to enhance the overall classification model and contribute valuable insights.

The Decision Tree and Random Forest algorithms demonstrated high accuracy on both training and testing datasets. Consequently, I aimed to enhance model generalization by employing a Fully Connected Deep Neural Network. This approach yielded a notable and more generalized fit for the data, effectively detecting both fraudulent and non-fraudulent transactions.
