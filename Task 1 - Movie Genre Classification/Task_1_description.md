# Task 1 : Movie Genre Classification 
## Description
During the first task of the internship, my primary objective was to construct a 
robust classification model for predicting movie genres based on
 the IMDB dataset, 
accessible at 
[dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hijest/genre-classification-dataset-imdb).
To achieve this, I systematically implemented and evaluated several machine learning algorithms.

The algorithms employed in this endeavor included 
* Multinomial Naive Bayes
* Support Vector Machine
* Logistic Regression 
* RandomForest
   
Each algorithm was meticulously chosen and fine-tuned to optimize its performance in the context of movie genre classification.

By utilizing a diverse set of machine learning approaches, the goal was to ascertain which algorithm or combination there of yielded the most accurate and reliable predictions for the given dataset. This comprehensive exploration aimed to enhance the overall classification model and contribute valuable insights.
